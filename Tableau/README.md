## About the Project

**Data Source**:
  - `date`: Date in format DD/MM/YYYY.
  - `tmax`: Maximum temperature of the day in 째F.
  - `tmin`: Minimum temperature of the day in 째F.
  - `tavg`: Average temperature of the day in 째F.
  - `departure`: Departure from normal temperature in 째F.
  - `HDD`: Heating Degree Days.
  - `CDD`: Cooling Degree Days.
  - `precipitation`: Precipitation in inches.
  - `new_snow`: New snowfall in inches.
  - `snow_depth`: Snowfall depth in inches.
 
  
**Description**:

- The purpose of creating a Tableau visualization showing the maximum temperature, minimum temperature, and average temperature for each day in New York City during 2019 is to provide a comprehensive and easily understandable representation of the city's daily temperature variations throughout the year. This visualization serves multiple insights and objectives:

**1. Seasonal Temperature Trends:** 

The visualization allows viewers to quickly identify the seasonal patterns in NYC's temperature. By plotting the maximum, minimum, and average temperatures on a daily basis, users can see how temperatures change throughout the year. For example:
   - High temperatures in summer and low temperatures in winter.
   - The transition between seasons, such as the gradual increase in temperatures in spring and the decline in fall.

**2. Temperature Extremes:** 

It helps in pinpointing extreme temperature events. By looking at the daily maximum and minimum temperatures, users can easily spot heatwaves, cold spells, or temperature records that occurred during the year.

**3. Daily Temperature Variability:** 

Viewers can gain insights into daily temperature fluctuations. The visualization shows how much temperatures can vary in a single day, providing a sense of the diurnal temperature range.

**4. Averaging and Smoothing:** 

The inclusion of the average temperature provides a smoothed representation of temperature trends. It helps viewers identify long-term changes and trends more easily, removing some of the noise associated with daily temperature fluctuations.

**5. Data Summary:** 

For data analysts and researchers, this visualization offers a summary of the temperature dataset for 2019. It can be a starting point for further, more detailed analysis or investigations into temperature-related phenomena.

**6. Historical Reference:** 

It provides a historical record of temperature data that can be used for comparison with other years or for validating climate models and predictions.

**7. Decision Support:** 

The visualization can be used by individuals and organizations to make informed decisions related to weather, such as planning outdoor activities, energy consumption, and climate-sensitive operations.

In summary, this Tableau visualization serves as an effective tool for presenting temperature data in a clear and informative manner, helping users to understand the yearly temperature patterns in NYC, identify temperature extremes, and make data-informed decisions based on historical temperature records. It is a valuable resource for both casual observers and those conducting more in-depth climate analysis.
