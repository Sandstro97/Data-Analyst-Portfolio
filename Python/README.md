## Project Overview:
In this data analytics project, I will analyze an e-commerce dataset to uncover trends in sales, customer behavior, and popular products. The goal is to provide insights into peak sales periods and purchasing patterns.

## Questions that need to be answered:
1. How was the sales trend over the months?
2. What are the most frequently purchased products?
3. How many products does the customer purchase in each transaction?
4. Based on your findings, what strategy could you recommend to the business to gain more profit?
